# Agencies

Pre-configured agency templates for different project types.

## What is an Agency?

An **Agency** is a pre-configured team of agents with optimized workflows for a specific type of project. Each agency defines:

- **Agent Roster** - Which agents are active
- **Workflow Pipeline** - How agents interact
- **Quality Gates** - Required approvals
- **MCP Adapters** - Available tools
- **Project Templates** - Starting artifacts

Software and MCP proposal baseline for all agencies:

## How to Use

### 1. Select Agency

Choose an agency that matches your project type:

```markdown
Project: E-commerce platform
→ Use: Software Studio
```

### 2. Reference Agency Config

The agency config is used by Router to set up the project:

```
Router reads agency config → Initializes project with agency settings
```

### 3. Customize (Optional)

Override agency defaults for project-specific needs:

- Add/remove agents
- Modify workflows
- Adjust quality gates

## Agency Structure

Each agency folder contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.md` | Agency configuration (agents, workflows, gates) |
| `pipeline.md` | Agent interaction pipeline |
| `templates.md` | Project templates and starting artifacts |

## Creating Custom Agencies

To create a custom agency:

1. Copy an existing agency folder
2. Modify `config.md` for your needs
3. Update `pipeline.md` for your workflow
4. Add project templates in `templates.md`

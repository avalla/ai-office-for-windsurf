# Agents

AI Office agent profiles, competencies, and capabilities.

## Structure

Each agent has its own folder containing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `personality.md` | Core personality traits and behavioral patterns |
| `competencies.md` | Skills, abilities, and areas of expertise |
| `triggers.md` | Conditions that activate this agent |
| `workflows.md` | Associated workflows this agent executes |
| `skills.md` | Internal skills (`.agents/skills/`) this agent uses |
| `mcp-adapters.md` | External MCP adapters this agent can leverage |

Software and MCP proposal baseline for all agents:

- `.agents/software-mcp-proposals.md` (Agent-Level Proposal Matrix)

## Usage

Agents are activated by:
1. **Workflow trigger** - Workflow explicitly invokes an agent
2. **Slash command** - User invokes agent directly (e.g., `/router`)
3. **Context reference** - Cascade references agent profile for guidance

## Communication

Agents communicate through:
- **Primary:** Project artifacts (`projects/<project>/.ai-agency/docs/`)
- **Secondary:** Memory system (decision logs, patterns)
- **Escalation:** Router → Planner → CEO

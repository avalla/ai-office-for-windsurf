description: Validate quality gates for a pipeline stage before advancing. Usage: /office-validate <slug> <stage>
---

Arguments: `<slug> <stage>`

- **slug**: project identifier
- **stage**: `prd` | `adr` | `plan` | `tasks` | `dev` | `security` | `qa` | `review` | `user_acceptance` | `release`

---

## Project Config (read first)

Before running any checklist, read `.ai-office/project.config.md` and extract the YAML frontmatter fields:

| Field | Fallback |
|---|---|
| `typecheck_cmd` | `npm run typecheck` |
| `lint_cmd` | `npm run lint` |
| `test_cmd` | `npm run test` |
| `coverage_min` | `80` |
| `lighthouse_min` | `90` |

If the file doesn't exist, use the fallback values and prepend this note to the output:
`ℹ️  No project.config.md found — using defaults. Run /office-setup to configure.`
